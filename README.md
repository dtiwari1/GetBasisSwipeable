The purpose of the task was to create a similar app to Google Primer app.

## Features
* Smooth user interface.
* Thread safe.
* Easy to use and customise the code.

## Task accomplishments

1. Fetch the data and display it as swipeable cards.
2. Swipe the card to move to the next card.
3. Go back to the previous card. (By swiping also. You can define the swiping gesture for previous card movement)
4. Restart it from the beginning.
5. Track the progress of the cards (Say, the current card is #4 out of 10, any indicator mentioning the progress.)
Please note that every json response starts with a '/' character. You need to parse it accordingly.
Your code will be judged on the basis of the architecture it follows and a proper separation of concerns.
